/**
 * @defgroup clusterDriver Cluster
 *
 * The cluster driver provides support for offload code execution to the cluster
 * side.
 *
 * Clusters must be mounted before they can be used. Once mounted, remote
 * function executions can be enqueued to offload computation to the cluster.
 * A remote execution is a multi-core execution. This starts execution only on
 * the cluster controller core, however the other cores of the cluster are
 * available for parallel computation through synchronization primitives.
