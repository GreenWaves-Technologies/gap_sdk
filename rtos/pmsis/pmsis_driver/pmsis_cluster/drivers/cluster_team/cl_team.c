 * to start multi-core processing.
 * The team parameters (number of cores and stacks) are by default the ones
 * configured when calling
 * the cluster entry point from the fabric controller. It is possible to use
 * different parameters
 * when doing a new fork. If this is done the new parameters will become the
 * new default ones.
 * If the number of cores is not provided (i.e. is zero), the number of cores
 * of the previous
 * fork will be reused. Doing this has less runtime overhead.
 *
 * \param        cores_mask The mask of cores which will enter the entry point.
 * If it is zero, this will reuse the cores_mask of the previous fork or the default.
 * \param        entry The function entry point to be executed by all cores of the team.
 * \param        arg    The argument of the function entry point.
