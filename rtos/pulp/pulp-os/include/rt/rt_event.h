/**        
 * @defgroup Event Event scheduler
 *
 * The asynchronous interactions between the fabric controller, the cluster and the peripherals are managed
 * with events on the fabric controller side.
 *
 * An event is a function callback which can be pushed to an event scheduler, for a deferred execution. 
 * All events in the same scheduler are executed in-order, in a FIFO manner.
 *
 * In order to manage several levels of event priorities, there may be several event schedulers at the same
 * time. The application is entered with one event scheduler already created in the runtime, which is the
 * one which can be used as the default scheduler. However the application can then create multiple
 * event schedulers in order to build a more complex multi-priority scenario.
 *
 * Event schedulers are only executed when specific actions are executed by the application. They can
 * be either invoked explicitly by calling rt_event_execute or implicitly when for example no thread
 * is active and the application is blocked waiting for something.
 *
 * The pool of events which can be pushed to schedulers must be explicitly managed by the application.
 * There is by default no event allocated. They must be first allocated before they can be pushed to
 * schedulers. This allows the application to decide the optimal number of events that it needs
 * depending on the various actions which can occur.
 *
 * When a scheduler is invoked, it executes all its pending events, unless the current thread is preempted
 * to schedule another thread. To execute an event, it removes it from the queue and executes the associated
 * callback with its argument, until the callback returns. This scheduler can not execute any other event
 * until the callback has returned.
 *
 * Each thread is assigned an event scheduler. By default, when a thread is created, it is assigned
 * the internal event scheduler. Another scheduler can then be assigned by the application.
 * This scheduler is the one implicitly invoked when the thread is calling a blocking operation such
 * as waiting for an event.
