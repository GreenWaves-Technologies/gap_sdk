#ifndef ONBOARD_MODEM_API_H_

/** onboard_modem_api is a standardizing API for Modem type devices under Mbed OS.
 * It provides a simple hardware abstraction layer on top of the modem drivers
 * written for Mbed OS.
 *
 * It is required from the engineers porting any modem type device (e.g., Cellular)
 * to provide an implementation of this API in their respective target folder as well as
 * usage of standard PinNames (in PinNames.h) is required. For example,
 *
 *   MDMTXD = P0_15,    // Transmit Data
 *   MDMRXD = P0_16,    // Receive Data
 *   MDMCTS = P0_17,    // Clear to Send
 *   MDMDCD = P0_18,    // Data Carrier Detect
 *   MDMDSR = P0_19,    // Data Set Ready
 *   MDMDTR = P0_20,    // Data Terminal Ready (set high or use handshake)
 *   MDMRI  = P0_21,    // Ring Indicator
 *   MDMRTS = P0_22,    // Request to Send (set high or use handshake)
 *
 *   MDM_PIN_POLARITY must also be defined as 0 (active low) or 1 (active high).
 *
 *   NOTE: This API should only be used when the modem exists on-board, i.e., the modem is
 *         NOT a plugged-in component.
