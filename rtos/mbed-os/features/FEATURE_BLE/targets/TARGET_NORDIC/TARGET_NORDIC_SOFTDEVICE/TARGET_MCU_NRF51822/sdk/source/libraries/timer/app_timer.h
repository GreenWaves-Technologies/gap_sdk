 *
 * @brief Application timer functionality.
 *
 * @details This module enables the application to create multiple timer instances based on the RTC1
 *          peripheral. Checking for time-outs and invokation of user time-out handlers is performed
 *          in the RTC1 interrupt handler. List handling is done using a software interrupt (SWI0).
 *          Both interrupt handlers are running in APP_LOW priority level.
 *
 * @details When calling app_timer_start() or app_timer_stop(), the timer operation is just queued,
 *          and the software interrupt is triggered. The actual timer start/stop operation is
 *          executed by the SWI0 interrupt handler. Since the SWI0 interrupt is running in APP_LOW,
 *          if the application code calling the timer function is running in APP_LOW or APP_HIGH,
 *          the timer operation will not be performed until the application handler has returned.
 *          This will be the case, for example, when stopping a timer from a time-out handler when not using
 *          the scheduler.
 *
 * @details Use the USE_SCHEDULER parameter of the APP_TIMER_INIT() macro to select if the
 *          @ref app_scheduler should be used or not. Even if the scheduler is 
 *          not used, app_timer.h will include app_scheduler.h, so when
 *          compiling, app_scheduler.h must be available in one of the compiler include paths.
