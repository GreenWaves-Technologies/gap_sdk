/**
 * iBeacon Service.
 *
 * @par Purpose
 *
 * iBeacons are Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices advertising an identification
 * number generally used to determine the location of devices or physical objects
 * near a mobile phone user.
 *
 * iOS scans for iBeacon devices in a background task and notifies apps
 * that subscribe to a specific region when a device enters or leaves an area. Apps may
 * use this information to display context-aware content to users.
 *
 * As an example, a museum can deploy an app that informs the user when one of
 * its exhibitions is entered and then displays specific information about exposed
 * pieces of art when the user is sufficiently close to them.
 *
 * @par Positioning
 *
 * Location information is hierarchically structured. A UUID specific to the
 * application and its deployment is used to identify a region. That region
 * usually identifies an organization. The region is divided into subregions
 * identified by a major ID. The subregion contains related points of interest
 * which a minor ID distinguishes.
 *
 * As an example, a city willing to improve tourist's experience can deploy a fleet
 * of iBeacons in relevant touristic locations it operates. The UUID may
 * identify a place managed by the city. The major ID would identify the place;
 * it can be a museum, a historic monument, a metro station and so on. The minor ID
 * would identify a specific spot within a specific city place. It can be a
 * piece of art, a ticket dispenser or a relevant point of interest.
 *
 * Each iBeacon device is physically attached to the spot it locates and
 * advertises the triplet UUID, major ID and minor ID.
 *
 * @par Proximity
 *
 * The beacon advertises the signal strength measured by an iOS device at a
 * distance of one meter. iOS uses this information to approximate the
 * proximity to a given beacon:
 *   - Immediate: The beacon is less than one meter away from the user.
 *   - Near: The beacon is one to three meters away from the user.
 *   - Far: The user is not near the beacon; the distance highly depends on
 *     the physical environment.
 *
 * Ideally, beacons should be calibrated at their deployment location because the
 * surrounding environment affects the strength of the advertised signal.
 *
 * @par Usage
 *
 * Mbed OS applications can use this class to configure a device to broadcast
 * advertising packets mimicking an iBeacon. The construction automatically
 * creates the payload identifying the beacon and registers it as part of the
 * advertising payload of the device.
 *
 * Beacon configuration and advertising commencement is left to the user.
 *
 * @attention If you are interested in manufacturing iBeacons, you must obtain a
 * license from Apple. More information at https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/.
 * The license also grant access to the iBeacons technical specification.
