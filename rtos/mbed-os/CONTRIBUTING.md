# Contributing to Mbed OS

Mbed OS is an open-source, device software platform for the Internet of Things. Contributions are an important part of the platform, and our goal is to make it as simple as possible to become a contributor.

To encourage productive collaboration, as well as robust, consistent and maintainable code, we have a set of guidelines for [contributing to Mbed OS](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/contributing/index.html).
