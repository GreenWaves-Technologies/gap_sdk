# Create and build CrossCore Embedded Studio projects
CrossCore Embedded Studio (CCES) can generate and build IDE projects from the command line using .json input files.

## Create a new project

Run the following headless tools command to create your CrossCore Embedded Studio project using the .json file generated by the ARM mbed exporter:
{% for operating_system, command in commands['create'].items() %}
### {{ operating_system }}
> {{ command }}

{% endfor %}
where "CCES_HOME" is an environment variable pointing to the root CCES installation directory and "WORKSPACE" is the path to the desired CCES workspace directory.

Once the CrossCore Embedded Studio project is generated, you can import the project into the IDE for development and debugging.

## Build a project
Once created, you can use headless tools to build the project with the following command:
{% for operating_system, command in commands['build'].items() %}
### {{ operating_system }}
> {{ command }}

{% endfor %}
where "CCES_HOME" is an environment variable pointing to the root CCES installation directory and "WORKSPACE" is the path to the desired CCES workspace directory.

For more information on how to use CrossCore Embedded Studio and headless tools, please see the CrossCore Embedded Studio Help.
