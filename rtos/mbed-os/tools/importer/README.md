## Importing repositories into mbed-os

importer.py script can be used to import code base from different repositories into mbed-os.

### Pre-requisties
1. Get the required repository clone and update it to commit required. Note: Repository should be placed outside the mbed-os.
2. Create json file as per template

### JSON file template

You can list all the files and folders which are required to be copied in config file in `file` and `folder` arrays respectively. Script will remove the files/folders specified in `src` section from mbed-os repository before copy operation is performed.
New commit is created on branch `feature_+repo_name+last_sha` with commit message "[REPO_NAME]: Updated to last_sha"

Note: Only files present in folder will be copied, directories inside the folder will not be copied.

`commit_sha` is list of commits present in mbed-os repo. These commits will be applied after copying files and folders listed above.Each commit in the commit_sha list is cherry-picked and applied with the -x option, which records the SHA of the source commit in the commit message.
Note: You must resolve any conflicts that arise during this cherry-pick process. Make sure that the "(cherry picked from commit ...)" statement is present in the commit message. Re-execute the python script to apply rest of the SHA commits.

{
  "files" : [
    {
      "src_file" : "CMSIS/Core/Template/ARMv8-M/tz_context.c",
      "dest_file" : "cmsis/TARGET_CORTEX_M/mbed_tz_context.c"
    },
    ...
    {
      "src_file" : "",
      "dest_file" : ""
    }
  ],
  "folders" : [
    {
      "src_folder" : "CMSIS/Core/Include/",
      "dest_folder" : "cmsis/TARGET_CORTEX_M/"
    },
    ...
    {
      "src_folder" : "",
      "dest_folder" : ""
    }
  ],
   "commit_sha" : [
      "428acae1b2ac15c3ad523e8d40755a9301220822",
      "d9d622afe0ca8c7ab9d24c17f9fe59b54dcc61c9",
    ]
}

### Input to importer.py
1. Repository: -r <repo_path> ( Example: CMSIS / Mbed-tls)
2. `repo`_importer.json: -c <json_file>  (Example: cmsis_importer.json)

For example the command below can be used to update CMSIS:
`python tools\importer\importer.py -c tools\importer\cmsis_importer.json -r <path to cmsis repo>`

Note: This script must be run from the mbed-os directory to work correctly.
