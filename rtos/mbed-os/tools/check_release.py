# Script to check a new mbed 2 release by compiling a set of specified test apps 
# for all currently supported platforms. Each test app must include an mbed library.
# This can either be the pre-compiled version 'mbed' or the source version 'mbed-dev'.
#
# Setup:
# 1. Set up your global .hgrc file
# 
#    If you don't already have a .hgrc file in your $HOME directory, create one there.
#    Then add the following section:
# 
#    [auth]
#    x.prefix = *
#    x.username = <put your mbed org username here>
#    x.password = <put your mbed org password here>
#
#    This has 2 purposes, the first means you don't get prompted for your password 
#    whenever you run hg commands on the commandline. The second is that this script
#    reads these details in order to fully automate the Mercurial commands.
# 
# Edit "check_release.json". This has the following structure:
#{
#  "config" : {
#    "mbed_repo_path" : "C:/Users/annbri01/Work/Mercurial"
#  },
#  "test_list" : [
#    {
#        "name" : "test_compile_mbed_lib",
#        "lib" : "mbed"
#    },
#    {
#        "name" : "test_compile_mbed_dev",
#        "lib" : "mbed-dev"
#    }
#  ],
#  "target_list" : []
#}
#
# The mbed_repo_path field should be changed to point to where your local
# working directory is for Mercurial repositories.
# For each test app you wish to run, add an entry to the test list. The example
# above has 2 test apps  
#     "test_compile_mbed_lib" and "test_compile_mbed_dev"
# The lib field in each says which type of mbed 2 library the app contains.
# These test apps MUST be available as repos in the user's online Mercurial area.
# The target_list allows the user to override the set of targets/platforms used 
# for the compilation.
# E.g to just compile for 2 targets, K64F and K22F :
# "target_list" : ["K64F", "K22F"]
#
# Run the script from the mbed-os directory as follows:
# > python tools/check_release.py 
#
# It will look for local clones of the test app repos. If they don't exist
# it will clone them. It will then read the latest versions of mbed and mbed-dev
# (an assumption is made that both of these are already cloned in your Mercurial area).
# The lib files within the test apps are then updated to the corresponding version in 
# the associated lib itself. The test apps are then committed and pushed back to the users
# fork.
# The test apps will then be compiled for all supported targets and a % result output at 
# the end.
#
# Uses the online compiler API at https://mbed.org/handbook/Compile-API
# Based on the example from https://mbed.org/teams/mbed/code/mbed-API-helper/
