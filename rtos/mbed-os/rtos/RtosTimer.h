/** The RtosTimer class allow creating and and controlling of timer functions in the system.
 A timer function is called when a time period expires whereby both on-shot and
 periodic timers are possible. A timer can be started, restarted, or stopped.

 Timers are handled in the thread osTimerThread.
 Callback functions run under control of this thread and may use CMSIS-RTOS API calls.

 @deprecated
 The RtosTimer has been superseded by the EventQueue. The RtosTimer and EventQueue duplicate
 the functionality of timing events outside of interrupt context, however the EventQueue
 has additional features to handle deferring other events to multiple contexts.

 For an example, the following code shows a simple use of the RtosTimer:
 @code
 DigitalOut led(LED1);
 void blink() {
     led = !led;
 }

 RtosTimer timer(&blink);
 int main() {
     timer.start(1000); // call blink every 1s
     wait_ms(5000);
     timer.stop(); // stop after 5s
 }
 @endcode

 This is the above example rewritten to use the EventQueue:
 @code
 DigitalOut led(LED1);
 void blink() {
     led = !led;
 }

 EventQueue queue(4*EVENTS_EVENT_SIZE);
 int main() {
    int blink_id = queue.call_every(1000, &blink); // call blink every 1s
    queue.dispatch(5000);
    queue.cancel(blink_id); // stop after 5s
 }
 @endcode

 @note
 Memory considerations: The timer control structures will be created on current thread's stack, both for the mbed OS
 and underlying RTOS objects (static or dynamic RTOS memory pools are not being used).
