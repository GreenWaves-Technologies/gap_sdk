struct Waiter;

/** The ConditionVariable class is a synchronization primitive that allows
 *   threads to wait until a particular condition occurs.
 *
 * Use the condition variable in conjunction with a mutex to safely wait for
 * or notify waiters of condition changes to a resource accessible by multiple
 * threads.
 *
 * The thread that intends to wait on a ConditionVariable must:
 * - Acquire a lock on a mutex.
 * - Execute `wait`, `wait_for` or `wait_until`. While the thread is waiting,
 *   the mutex is unlocked.
 * - When the condition variable has been notified, or in the case of `wait_for`
 *   and `wait_until` the timeout expires, the thread is awakened.
 *
 * The thread that intends to notify a ConditionVariable must:
 * - Acquire a lock on the mutex used to construct the condition variable.
 * - Execute `notify_one` or `notify_all` on the condition variable.
 *
 * All threads waiting on the condition variable wake when
 *   `ConditionVariable::notify_all` is called.
 * At least one thread waiting on the condition variable wakes
 *   when `ConditionVariable::notify_one` is called.
 *
 * While a thread is waiting for notification of a
 *   ConditionVariable, it releases the lock held on the mutex.
 * The ConditionVariable reacquires the mutex lock before exiting the wait
 *   function.
 *
 * #### Unspecified behavior
 * - The thread that is unblocked on `ConditionVariable::notify_one` is
 *   unspecified if there are multiple waiters.
 * - When `ConditionVariable::notify_one` or `ConditionVariable::notify_all` is
 *   called and there are one or more waiters, and one or more threads
 *   attempting to acquire the condition variable's mutex, the order in which the mutex is
 *   acquired is unspecified.
 * - Spurious notifications (not triggered by the application) can occur.
 *
 * #### Undefined behavior
 * - Calling wait if the mutex is not locked by the current thread is undefined
 *   behavior.
 * - The order in which waiting threads acquire the condition variable's
 *   mutex after `ConditionVariable::notify_all` is called is undefined.
 * - The behavior of `ConditionVariable::wait` and `ConditionVariable::wait_for`
 *   is undefined if the condition variable's mutex is locked more than once by
 *   the calling thread.
 *
 * @note Synchronization level: Thread safe
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 *
 * Mutex mutex;
 * ConditionVariable cv(mutex);
 *
 * // These variables are protected by locking the mutex.
 * uint32_t work_count = 0;
 * bool done = false;
 *
 * void worker_thread()
 * {
 *   // Acquire lock on mutex before accessing protected variables and waiting.
 *   mutex.lock();
 *
 *   while (done == false) {
 *     printf("Worker thread: Count: %lu\r\n", work_count);
 *
 *     // Wait for main thread to notify the condition variable.
 *     printf("Worker thread: Waiting\r\n");
 *     cv.wait();
 *   }
 *
 *   printf("Worker: Exiting\r\n");
 *
 *   // The condition variable acquires the lock when exiting the `wait` function.
 *   // Unlock mutex when exiting the thread.
 *   mutex.unlock();
 * }
 *
 * int main()
 * {
 *   Thread thread;
 *   thread.start(worker_thread);
 *
 *   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
 *     // Acquire lock on mutex before modifying variables and notifying.
 *     mutex.lock();
 *
 *     // Change count and notify waiters.
 *     work_count++;
 *     printf("Main thread: Set count to: %lu\r\n", work_count);
 *     printf("Main thread: Notifying worker thread\r\n");
 *     cv.notify_all();
 *
 *     // Mutex must be unlocked before the worker thread can acquire it.
 *     mutex.unlock();
 *
 *     wait(1.0);
 *   }
 *
 *   // Change done and notify waiters of this.
 *   mutex.lock();
 *   done = true;
 *   cv.notify_all();
