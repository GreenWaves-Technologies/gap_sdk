		Filter_Q: Filter fixed point format
		Bias_Q: Bias fixed point format
		Out_Q: Out fixed point format
		For CNN_ConvolutionPoolReLU:
		bias norm si calcualted as Filter_Q+In_Q-Bias_Q
		while output adjust is calculated as Filter_Q+In_Q-Out_Q
		for multiplicative bias you can see formula in generators.
