This example shows how to capture images from the camera and display them on the LCD on the Gapuino board.
It can be run on the board with command "make all run" or on gvsoc with command "make all run platform=gvsoc".
On gvsoc, the Makefile is giving a PGM file to the camera model which is using it to generate the input CPI stream to the chip.
