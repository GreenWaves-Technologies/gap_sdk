# IMel

This project generates and run functions to apply Mel spectrogram and Inverse Mel spectrogram over a speech audio file and write the results to 2 files (GapMel.bin and GapInvMel.bin).

The Mel spectrogram settings are defined in MelConfig.json, from it and the description of MelModel.c the DSP functions are generated by the Autotiler with double buffering between L2 and L1 in the BUILD_DSP folder. Besides them, also the LUT used for FFT and Mel Filtering are generated by a python script. The files dependencies are defined in MelModel.mk.

To run the application:

	make clean clean_mel_code all run platform=gvsoc

Then to inspect the outputs with matplotlib:

	python test.py
