# MatMul Test

This test computes a Matrix Multiplication with different data types (float32, Fixed point 16 bits, float16). The code is generated by the autotiler to maximize the performance. 

The Matrixes are initially stored in L2 and the code generated tiles and double buffers the data movement between L2 and L1. To check the results a sequential, non-optimized MatMul is computed by the cluster master in the main code.

To run the code with Mat1 [50x100] and Mat2 [100x20] --> Out [50x20]:

	make clean clean_matmul_code all run H_M1=50 W_M1=100 W_M2=20

A version running with standard x86 can be compiled with Emul.mk:

	make -f Emul.mk clean clean_matmul_code all
	./matmul_emul
