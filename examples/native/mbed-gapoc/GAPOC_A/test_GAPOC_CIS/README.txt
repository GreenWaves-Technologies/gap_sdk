See header text in source code of test_GAPOC_CIS.c for outline of what this test does.
Captured images can either (depending on #define in source code) be sent over SPI to an LCD Display (AdaFruit 2.8" TFT Shield or equivalent) or be stored (using the debug bridge ==> JTAG must be connected) on a host PC as .ppm files.  
.pmm files can be viwed with an image viewer such as "eog".
