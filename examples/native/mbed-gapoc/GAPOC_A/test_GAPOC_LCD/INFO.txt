test_LCD:
=========

This test assumes an LCD Display is attached to GAPOC.
The supported LCD is Adafruit's 2.8" TFT Touch Shield v2.x
Connections to GAPOC are as follows:

Shield Digital.13 = SCLK     = GAPOC Connector 3 Position 5 = GAP8 Pin B4 (SPI1M_SCK)
Shield Digital.12 = MISO     = GAPOC Connector 3 Position 4 = GAP8 Pin A4 (SPI1M_MISO)
Shield Digital.11 = MOSI     = GAPOC Connector 3 Position 3 = GAP8 Pin B3 (SPI1M_MOSI) 
Shield Digital.10 = TFT_CS   = GAPOC Connector 3 Position 6 = GAP8 Pin A5 (SPI1M_CS0)
Shield Digital.9  = TFT_D/C  = GAPOC Connector 3 Position 2 = GAP8 Pin A3 (GPIOA0) 
[It may be a good idea to connect the above pins through a series resistor (e.g. a few 100ohm) for dampening and protection]

Shield GND = e.g. Connector 3 Position 7
Shield "5V" = GAPOC Connector 4 Position 4 = VROOT/3.6V
The "5V" input to the LCD actually receives 3.6V. This is OK; I/Os of the shield are down-converted to 3V anwyay; only the LCD backlight getting 3.6V instead of 5V is a bit weaker (darker).


- Configure SPI and LCD
- Loop on :
  . erase screen
  . display some colored text
  . display a greyscale test pattern
  [Do this using different API funtions of the LCD library]
