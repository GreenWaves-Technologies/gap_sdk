Power models
------------

This is for now a very preliminary work. Power traces can be showed when VCD traces are activated. Each power source is able to register an amount of energy, which is showed inside a VCD trace as a pulse.

For now only the core is registering the energy consumed by an instruction, but all instructions are assigned a fixed cost, which just has an arbitrary value.

A more detailed power report will soon be produced, and power sources added.
