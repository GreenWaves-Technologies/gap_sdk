Application profiling
---------------------

The virtual platform is for now not providing any particular feature in terms of profiling except for hardware performance counters whose most of them are modeled.

To use them, the test should configure and use them as on the real silicon, with the difference that on gvsoc all performance counters are implemented, not only one.
